# ***Decision Trees in Machine Learning***

## 📚 Overview

This repository demonstrates the use of **Decision Trees** in machine learning using the Titanic dataset. Decision Trees are a widely used, interpretable algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. This project covers:

- ✨ An introduction to **Decision Trees**.
- 🔄 Data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values and encoding categorical data.
- 🛠 Implementation of a **Decision Tree classifier** using Scikit-learn.
- 📊 Visualization of the tree structure and feature importance.

## 🎯 Features

- **Dataset**: Titanic dataset is used for predicting passenger survival.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature encoding, and irrelevant feature removal.
- **Model Training**: Building and visualizing a Decision Tree model.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance with metrics like accuracy.
- **Visualization**:
  - 🌳 **Decision Tree structure.**
  - 🔥 **Feature importance chart.**
